This is a prolog project which i did to learn about AI concepts like intelligent agents, Lists, Uninformed search and informed search.
it is composed of two problems.
First problem is to find all combinations of three numbers in ascending order that by adding would result in the given goal,
for example try the following
if the query is: threeSum([3,8,9,10,12,14],27,Output).
Answer would be: Output=[8,9,10] and Output=[3,10,14]

Second problem is to delete the first instance of a given letter from an array of characters.
for example try the following
if the query is: deletiveEditing(['K','A','R','I','M'],['R','M'])
this would output true but,
if the query is: deletiveEditing(['K','A','R','I','M'],['A','L'])
this would output false.
